 Post-Quantum Traditional (PQ/T) Hybrid Authentication in the Internet
                     Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)
                draft-hu-ipsecme-pqt-hybrid-auth-latest

Abstract

   One IPsec area that would be impacted by Cryptographically Relevant
   Quantum Computer (CRQC) is IKEv2 authentication based on traditional
   asymmetric cryptograph algorithms: e.g RSA, ECDSA; which are widely
   deployed authentication options of IKEv2.  There are new Post-Quantum
   Cryptograph (PQC) algorithms for digital signature like NIST
   [ML-DSA], however it takes time for new cryptograph algorithms to
   mature, so there is security risk to use only the new algorithm
   before it is field proven.  This document describes a IKEv2 hybrid
   authentication scheme that could contain both traditional and PQC
   algorithms, so that authentication is secure as long as one algorithm
   in the hybrid scheme is secure.

1.  Changes in -01

   *  Only use SUPPORTED_AUTH_METHODS for algorithm combination
      announcement, no longer use SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS

   *  add flag field in the announcement

   *  clarify two types of PKI setup

   *  add some clarifications on how AUTH payload is computed

2.  Introduction

   A Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) could break
   traditional asymmetric cryptograph algorithms: e.g RSA, ECDSA; which
   are widely deployed authentication options of IKEv2.  New Post-
   Quantum Cryptograph (PQC) algorithms for digital signature were
   recently published like NIST [ML-DSA], however consider potential
   flaws in the new algorithm's specifications and implementations, it
   will take time for these new PQC algorithms to be field proven.  So
   it is risky to only use PQC algorithms before they are mature.  There
   is more detailed discussion on motivation of a hybrid approach for
   authentication in Section 1.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-pquip-hybrid-signature-spectrums].

   This document describes an IKEv2 hybrid authentication scheme that
   contains both traditional and PQC algorithms, so that authentication
   is secure as long as one algorithm in the hybrid scheme is secure.

   Each IPsec peer announce the support of hybrid authentication via
   SUPPORTED_AUTH_METHODS notification as defined in [RFC9593],
   generates and verifies AUTH payload using composite signature like
   the procedures defined in [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].

   Following two types of setup are covered:

   1.  Type-1: A single certificate that has composite key as defined in
       [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs]

   2.  Type-2: Two certificates, one with traditional algorithm key and
       one with PQC algorithm key

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC): A quantum
   computer that is capable of breaking real world cryptographic
   systems.

   Post-Quantum Cryptograph (PQC) algorithms: Asymmetric cryptograph
   algorithms are thought to be secure against CRQC.

   Traditional Cryptograph algorithms: Existing asymmetric cryptograph
   algorithms could be broken by CRQC, like RSA, ECDSA ..etc.

4.  IKEv2 Key Exchange

   There is no changes introduced in this document to the IKEv2 key
   exchange process, although it MUST be also resilient to CRQC when
   using along with the PQ/T hybrid authentication, for example key
   exchange using the PPK as defined in [RFC8784], or hybrid key
   exchanges that include PQC algorithm via multiple key exchange
   process as defined in [RFC9370].

5.  Exchanges

   The hybrid authentication exchanges is illustrated in an example
   depicted in Figure 1, the key exchange uses PPK, however it could be
   other key exchanges that involves PQC algorithm since how key
   exchange is done is transparent to authentication.

5.1.  Announcement

   Announcement of support hybrid authentication is through
   SUPPORTED_AUTH_METHODS notification as defined in [RFC9593], which
   includes a list of acceptable authentication methods announcements,
   this document defines a hybrid authentication announcements with

      -  C: set to 1 if the algorithm could be used in type-1 setup

      -  S: set to 1 if the algorithm could be used in type-2 setup

      -  C and S MUST NOT be zero at the same time

   *  AlgorithmIdentifier N: The variable-length ASN.1 object that is
      encoded using Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690] and
      identifies the algorithm of a composite signature as defined in
      Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].

5.1.1.  Sending Announcement

   As defined in [RFC9593], responder include SUPPORTED_AUTH_METHODS in
   IKE_SA_INIT response (and potentially also in IKE_INTERMEDIATE
   response), while initiator include the notification in IKE_AUTH
   request.

   Sender include a hybrid authentication announcement in
   SUPPORTED_AUTH_METHODS, which contains 0 or N composite signature
   AlgorithmIdentifiers sender accepts, each AlgorithmIdentifier
   identifies a combination of algorithms:

   *  a traditional PKI algorithm with corresponding hash algorithm
      (e.g. id-RSASA-PSS with id-sha256)

   *  a PQC algorithm (e.g. id-ML-DSA-44)

      -  in case of Hash ML-DSA, there is also a pre-hash algorithm
         (e.g. id-sha256)

   In case of type-2 setup, even though the certificate is not composite
   key certificate, system still uses a composite signature algorithm
   that corresponds to the combination of two certificates PKI
   algorithms and hash algorithm(s).

   C and S bits in flag field are set according to whether sender accept
   the algorithm combination in type-1/type-2 setup.

   Announcement without any AlgorithmIdentifiers signals that there is
   no particular restrictions on algorithm.

5.1.2.  Receiving Announcement

   If hybrid authentication announcement is received, and receiver
   choose to authenticate itself using hybrid authentication, then based
   on its local policy and certificates, one AlgorithmIdentifier (which
   identify a combination of algorithms) in the hybrid authentication
   announcement and a PKI setup (type-1 or type-2) are chosen to create
   its AUTH and CERT payload(s).

5.2.  AUTH & CERT payload

   The IKEv2 AUTH payload has following format as defined in Section 3.8
   of [RFC7296]:

                           1                   2                   3

            Figure 5: Authentication Data in hybrid AUTH payload

   Based on selected AlgorithmIdentifier and setup type, the Signature
   Value is created via procedure defined in Section 5.2.1,
   Section 5.2.2.

5.2.1.  Type-1

   Assume selected AlgorithmIdentifier is A.

   1.  There is no change on data to be signed, e.g.
       InitiatorSignedOctets/ResponderSignedOctets as defined in
       Section 2.15 of [RFC7296]

   2.  Follow Sign operation identified by A, e.g.  Section 4.2.1 of
       [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs] or Section 4.3.1 of
       [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs]; the ctx input is the string
       of "IKEv2-PQT-Hybrid-Auth".

   Following is an initiator example:

   1.  A is id-HashMLDSA44-RSA2048-PSS-SHA256, which uses Hash ML-DSA-44

   2.  Follow Section 4.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs] with
       following input:

       *  sk is the private key of the signing composite key certificate

       *  M is InitiatorSignedOctets

       *  ctx is "IKEv2-PQT-Hybrid-Auth"

       *  PH is SHA256

   The signing composite certificate MUST be the first CERT payload.

5.2.2.  Type-2

   The procedure is same as Type-1, use private key of traditional and
   PQC certificate accordingly; e.g. in Sign procedure define in
   Section 4.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs], the mldsaSK is
   the private key of ML-DSA certificate, while tradSK is the private
   key of traditional certificate.

   With the example in Section 5.2.1:

   *  mldsaSK is the private key of ML-DSA certificate, tradSK is the
      private key of the RSA certificate

   *  M is InitiatorSignedOctets

   *  ctx is "IKEv2-PQT-Hybrid-Auth"

   *  PH is SHA256

   The signing PQC certificate MUST be the first CERT payload in the
   IKEv2 message, while traditional certificate MUST be the second CERT
   payload.

5.2.2.1.  RelatedCertificate

   In type-2 setup, the signing certificate MAY contain
   RelatedCertificate extension, then the receiver SHOULD verify the
   extension according to Section 4.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cert-binding-for-multi-auth], failed verification
   SHOULD fail authentication.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security of general PQ/T hybrid authentication is discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-pquip-hybrid-signature-spectrums].

   This document uses mechanisms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs], [RFC7427] and [RFC9593], the
   security discussion in the corresponding RFCs also apply.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests a value in "IKEv2 Authentication Method"
   subregistry under IANA "Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)
   Parameters" registry
